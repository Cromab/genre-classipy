# genre-classipy
This project aims to classify Musical Genres using Convolutional Neural Networks and spectral features with librosa. This was trained on an intentionally small dataset in an effort to get a high accuracy with an expensive model. This was trained on the [GTZAN Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification), from which a near 80% accuracy was achieved.

This model requires being run itself, but seed has been provided.
